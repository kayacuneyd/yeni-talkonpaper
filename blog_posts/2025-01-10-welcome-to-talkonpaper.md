# Welcome to TalkOnPaper

We're excited to introduce **TalkOnPaper**, a platform designed to break down language, geography, and visa barriers in academic research dissemination.

## Our Mission

Academic knowledge should be accessible globally, but language barriers and travel restrictions limit the reach of important research. TalkOnPaper solves this by enabling researchers to:

- Present their published work in English-dubbed videos
- Reach global audiences without physical travel
- Maintain academic rigor through DOI-verified paper references
- Optimize for search engine discoverability

## How It Works

1. **Submit Your Paper**: Provide your published paper's DOI or reference URL
2. **Record or Dub**: Present in your native language or use our premium dubbing service
3. **Reach Global Audiences**: Your talk is indexed, searchable, and accessible worldwide

## Key Features

### DOI-First Approach
Every talk on TalkOnPaper maps to a verified published paper. This ensures academic credibility and provides permanent, citable references.

### SEO-Optimized
We've built the platform with search engine optimization in mind. VideoObject structured data, canonical URLs, and rich meta tags ensure your research is discoverable.

### Archive-Ready
All videos are stored with permanent URLs, making them suitable for citation in papers, grant applications, and academic portfolios.
